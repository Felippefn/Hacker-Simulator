 <h2>This is a beginner hacker simulator made in Python, enjoy!</h2>


Codes are simple, made just for fun.
Basically you start by creating your Log-In to a hacker programm, then  check your network and get a virtual machine as host to start hacking.
You can: 
<p>Steal money from other account
<br></br>Invade new machines<br></br>
Connect in random ip's<br></br>
Different ways to break into security<br></br>
And more...</p>
